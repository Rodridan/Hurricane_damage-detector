# Hurricane_damage-detector
automated detection and classification of hurricane-induced structural damage using deep learning on aerial or satellite imagery.

## Project Overview
This repository contains all code, utilities, and documentation for building, training, evaluating, and deploying deep learning models for hurricane damage assessment. The goal is to provide an end-to-end framework supporting data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and result visualization in a scalable and maintainable manner.

### Features
- Modular code structure: Separation of data loading, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation for clarity and reusability.

- Configurable training pipelines: Easily adjustable settings for dataset splits, image dimensions, batch sizes, and model parameters.

- Efficient data handling: Use of TensorFlow Datasets and memory-efficient generators for large-scale imagery.

- Visualization utilities: Tools for inspecting classification performance, confusion matrices, false positives/negatives, and Grad-CAM explainability.

- Jupyter notebooks: For exploratory data analysis, prototyping, and step-by-step documentation.

- Comprehensive documentation: Including setup instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.
